# Automated_Asana_Demo_App_LoopQA_Assessments
This project demonstrates automating the login and task verification for the Asana Demo App using Playwright. The goal was to automate login, navigate through the application, and verify the presence of specific tasks and tags across "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done" columns in both Web Application and Mobile Application sections.
